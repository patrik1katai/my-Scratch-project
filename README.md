# my-Scratch-project

My Scratch project is a funny little quiz story, set in outer space. 
I used the Text To Speech feature for more immersion, as well as a ghost effect when one character exits.

Follow the instructions to play. 
Hint: Make sure you type 'yes' in the first prompt to start the quiz.
